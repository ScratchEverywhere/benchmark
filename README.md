# Scratch Runtime Benchmarking Utilities

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Your runtime must either support the Scratch Addons Debug Addon or have list
> monitor support for this benchmark to work. It also must have some basic
> features like custom blocks, lists, variables, casting, comparisons, looping,
> and joining.

Clone the repo with `--recursive` and then run `./build.sh` to generate the
`.sb3`s. Then you can simply run the projects for the results.

If you want to work on one of the projects simply edit it then run `./break.sh`
before committing.
